 ## Handwritten Recognition of Arabic script


**Objectives:**

This assignment aims to introduce students to the challenges and techniques of Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here are some main objectives
**● Building a Basic CNN for AHCR, which includes:**

✔ Network architecture: define a basic CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions.
✔ Loss function and optimization: Introduce the concept of loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy) and optimizers (e.g., Adam) for training the CNN.
✔ Training and evaluation: Guide students through training the model on a provided dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy.
✔ Visualization: Instruct students to visualize the CNN model's performance, such as the loss curve.

**● Exploring advanced techniques, including:**
✔ Introduce data augmentation techniques: Discuss how techniques like random cropping, rotation, and elastic deformations can improve model generalizability.
✔ Explore the use of pre-trained models: Consider incorporating pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16) and fine-tuning them for AHCR.
✔ Touch upon more advanced architectures: Briefly mention deeper and more complex CNN architectures like ResNet or DenseNet and their potential in AHCR.
